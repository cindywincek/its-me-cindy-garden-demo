# About Cindy

**My North Star: Clarity**

I’m entering 2026 with one intention: clarity. Clarity in what I value, how I make decisions, what I’m building, and how I want to move through my life. I’ve lived long enough to know what happens when I don’t have it—chaos creeps in, overwhelm takes over, and I disconnect from myself. I’m not available for that anymore.
This website is the framework that keeps me grounded, honest, and connected to who I’m becoming.

**How I Think (My Cognitive Signature)**

I am a semantic-first thinker. I perceive meaning, pattern, essence, trajectory, and vibe before I see steps or details.
This is why I publish: Externalizing my thinking is the most effective way to process and refine my semantic patterns. This space is my digital garden, where I turn raw thoughts into structured insights.

**My Guiding Principles**
- Simplicity over complexity: I choose systems and routines that are simple, repeatable, and low-friction.
- Intention First: If something doesn’t support clarity, it doesn’t get my energy.
- Learning in Public: I focus on knowing the facts, noticing my reactions, and turning both into something written that I can return to.

**2026 Focus Themes**
**Visibility:** Building and maintaining this personal website.
**Depth** Engaging in focused research and synthesis.
**Flow:** Prioritizing creative and low-friction output.
