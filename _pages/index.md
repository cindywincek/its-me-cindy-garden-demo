# Welcome! 🌱

This is my corner of the internet...

This is my corner of the internet—a space to think out loud, follow my curiosity, and put my reflections somewhere other than my head. It is a public notebook dedicated to achieving Clarity in my life and work.

I write about the things I’m learning, the systems I’m building, and the questions I can’t shake. Nothing here is meant to be final; it’s just me showing my work as I go.

  Learn more about me! <span style="font-weight: bold"> [[about]] </span> to get started on your exploration.

This digital garden template is free, open-source, and [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/meewgumi/digital-garden-ghpages-template).

To set up on Github Pages:
- Set Github Pages build location to `docs` directory in Settings
- Put full site url in `baseurl` in `_config.yml`
- run `bundle` and `bundle exec jekyll serve` on your local machine to generate `docs`
- Publish repository to Github Pages
- It should work!

This template was modified for Github Pages by [Megumi Tanaka](https://megumi.co). It is based on Maxime Vaillancourt's [digital garden jekyll template](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll), originally running on Netlify. If this template helps you in any way, [consider buying Maxime a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/maximevaillancourt)! ☕️
